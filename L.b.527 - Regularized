Dear Sir,
I am compelled to write to you due to the inward accusations in my conscience that I have offended
you in a way that cannot be redeemed by me. The
heavy displeasure of my lord, which follows my offense, also forces me to write,
although I am aware that my fault makes my letters appear unfavorable to you.
I call upon Almighty God as my witness to testify that my only grief
is that I have offended you and Him in this manner.
I sincerely hope that with a humble and afflicted heart,
I can convey my current state to you. Since we have no means to move
God, when He does not listen to our prayers, except through
prayer itself, I humbly beseech you to grant my penitence a good reception,
following His gracious example, so that it may be believed
and pitied. Regarding the accusations laid against me,
I cannot defend myself against any of them except for the contemptuous
and spiteful intentions towards you, which are rumored to exist.
However, I leave it to those who have observed my dutiful regard for my late
lady, my religion, and my life
to judge me. I humbly implore
you to set aside these rumors and evaluate my fault on
its own merits, without the addition of these
negative reports. Although it will weigh heavily on
me, it will be less burdensome for you to forgive it.
You are wise and guided by your religious beliefs,
and you know well how little comfort and pleasure destruction brings.
Although you may not intend complete destruction,
the path on which I am falling towards it is so steep
that once pushed, I will quickly reach the bottom.
It pleases God, from whom I acknowledge the punishment
to be just, to afflict me with illness in addition to my other misfortunes.
I have no refuge except for His mercy, which I earnestly beg for 


from Him, my lord, and you. I hope that you will not regret
granting me this mercy, as all my efforts and the entirety
of my life will be dedicated to becoming deserving
of your favor and love. I know that the peace of conscience
and tranquility of the one I love will be greatly wounded and violated
if your displeasure separates us. I can present nothing to your
thoughts that you did not already know, except for my submission,
repentance, and heartfelt desire to do anything that may satisfy
your just displeasure. I beseech you to
interpret and construe this in a charitable manner.
From the fleet, 11th February 1601,

Yours faithfully
and obediently,
I. Donne




To the Right Worshipful
Sir George More, Knight.
