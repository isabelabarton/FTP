Dear Lord, I am sending you two letters 
that were found by a carrier on the highway to Chester, two miles
before the town of Nantwich. The carrier brought them to
Stone, to a person named Thomas Rathbon at the Crown Inn. 
Upon opening and reading their contents, he forwarded them 
to me. One of the letters contains matters that reveal the 
treasonous intentions of disloyal subjects who are envious of the 
peaceful state of our country and desire to bring about changes. 
The other letter is of lesser importance, but I 
suspect that its sender might be the brother of someone who was executed alongside 
Babington. This suspicion raises concerns about potential revenge, 
which I hope can be prevented through your Lordship's intervention.
With utmost respect, I entrust you to the mercy of the Almighty.
Blithfield, 27th February 1595.
