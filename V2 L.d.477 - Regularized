With my very hearty commendations I have here enclosed
sent you the names of diverse very dangerous recusants
dwelling near unto Wisbech Castle whom I pray you
to take some course for either by yourself or some other
Justices of the peace thereabouts That they may be bound
over to appear at the next assizes to be holden for the
County of Norfolk to answer unto such matters as shall be
objected against them on her Majesty's behalf And even
so I bid you very heartily farewell; At Sergeant's Inn
this 20th of June 1599

Your very loving friend
John Popham
