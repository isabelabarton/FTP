With my very hearty commendations, I have enclosed
and sent you the names of diverse very dangerous recusants
dwelling near to Wisbech Castle. I pray you
to take some course, either by yourself or some other
justices of the peace in that area, to have them bound
over to appear at the next assizes to be held for the
County of Norfolk. They should answer to the charges that will be
brought against them on behalf of Her Majesty. And
so, I bid you a very hearty farewell. This is written at Sergeant's Inn
on the 20th of June 1599.

Your very loving friend,
Jo: Popham
