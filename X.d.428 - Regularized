Dear Honorable [Recipient's Name],With our utmost humility and 
gratitude, we express our sincere thanks for your generous kindness and support at all 
times. My wife and I have taken the liberty to present

to accept them graciously. Furthermore, we fervently 
pray to Almighty God to grant your honorable 
self many joyful and prosperous new years. We also 
humbly request your daily blessings upon both of us.
We take our leave, with the utmost humility.

Yours sincerely and obediently,
Henry Cavendish
