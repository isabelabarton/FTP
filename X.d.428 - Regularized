Ryght Honorable, With our most humble and dutiful
thanks, for your Ladyship's bountiful goodness towards us at all
times, my Wife and I have made bold to present
your Honorable good Lady, With such poor and homely things, for
a simple New Year's gift, as this place can afford, beseeching 
that according to your Ladyship's accustomed goodness,
you Will vouchsafe them in good part; and we shall
pray most earnestly to God Almighty, to send your Honorable
Lady, many happy and healthful New Year's. And so
humbly craving your Ladyship's daily blessing to us both,
We most humbly take our leave.
Tutbery the last of December 1605
Your Ladyship's humble and
obedient son
