Dear Madame Hauinge, No
better means to manifest my thankfulness to your
honor. But by these lines, I humbly pray your ladyship to accept
them and in them my reverent thanks for your
honored many and great favors. And among the rest, that
it pleased your honor to lend me your ladyship's letter, which,
but for that, I think I should hardly have attained the end of my
journey, so dangerous was the weather.
But I beseech your honor to believe that I hold myself so much
bound to your ladyship as I will ever endeavor to deserve
by my duty and affectionate respect. Services to your ladyship.
Thus, praying your honor many happy years with health,
I humbly take leave.
Your honor's most dutiful and
most obedient,
Elizabeth Cavendish

Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William
Cavendish, married to

I.) Mother of the virtuous
Lady Arabella, who was
so near to the crown she
fell a sacrifice to
state policy.
