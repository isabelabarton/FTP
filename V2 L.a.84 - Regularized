Right honorable my very good Lord, I send you herein two
letters found by a Carrier in the high way to Chester, two miles
on this side the town of Nantwich, which he brought with him to
Stone to one Thomas Rathbon, innkeeper there at the sign of the Crown,
who, breaking them up, and perusing the contents, sent them
to me. And for that there is matter in the one manifesting
the traitorous minds of disloyal subjects, envying the
quiet state of our country, with a desire of alteration, as may
appear, the other not importing so much. Yet, for that I
greatly suspect him to be the brother of one executed with
Babington, which might cause him to bear a revengeful mind,
which I hope by your Lordship's good means will be prevented. And
so, with all humble duty, I commit you to the mercy of the Almighty.
Blithfield, the 27th of February 1595.
