Right honorable my very good Lord I send you herein two
letters found by a Carrier in the highway to Chester, two miles
on this side the town of Nantwich, which he brought with him to
Stone to one Thomas Rathbon, Innkeeper there at the sign of the Crown
who breaking them up, & perusing the Contents sent them
to me, And for that there is matter in the one manifesting the
the traitorous minds of unloyal subjects, envying the
quiet estate of our Country, with desire of alteration as may
appear, The other not importing so much, yet for that I
greatly suspect him to be the brother of one executed with
Babington might cause him to bear a Revenging mind
which I hope by your Lordship's good means will be prevented, And
so with all humble duty commit you to the mercy of the Almighty
Blithfield the 27th of February 1595
