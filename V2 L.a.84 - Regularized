Dear Lord, I am sending you two
letters that were discovered by a carrier on the road to Chester, two miles
before the town of Nantwich. The carrier brought them to
Stone and delivered them to a person named Thomas Rathbon, an inkkeeper at the Crown
Inn. Upon opening the letters and reading their contents, he sent them
to me. One of the letters contains information
about traitorous individuals who are disloyal
to our country and desire to bring about changes.
The other letter is not as significant, but I
suspect that its sender may be the brother of someone who was executed with
Babington. This suspicion leads me to believe that he might harbor vengeful intentions,
which I hope can be prevented with your assistance.
With utmost respect, I entrust you to the mercy of the Almighty.
Blithfield, 27th February 1595.
