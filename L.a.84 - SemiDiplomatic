Honorable Lord, I humbly present to you two
letters discovered by a carrier on the road to Chester, a short distance
from the town of Nantwich. The carrier delivered them to
Stone, specifically to Tho: Rathbon, at the inn known as the Crown.
Upon opening and reviewing their contents, he forwarded them
to me. One of the letters contains significant evidence of
disloyal subjects harboring treasonous intentions, displaying discontent with the
peaceful state of our country and expressing a desire for change.
The other letter, although less consequential, raises
suspicion due to its possible connection to the brother of an individual who was executed alongside
Babington. This association might fuel a vengeful mindset,
which I trust your Lordship can help prevent through your esteemed influence.
With utmost humility, I entrust you to the merciful protection of the Almighty.
Blithfield, 27th February 1595.
