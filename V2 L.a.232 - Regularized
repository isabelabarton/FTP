My ever good brother, Mr. Higgins' opinion was that my partner must
be at the bath before May, he has gone thither and on Saturday
I shall hear Doctor Sherwood's opinion: at which time
I would gladly have your coachman William here, if it
pleases you. I have sent by this bearer a young mare to
Sir B. for his old one that died on the way to Cambridge.
My man thinks her as good. I desire much the payment
of Sir Walter Harcourt, which I hope I shall hear of by
your man, with my humble duty to my good mother,
my partner's heartiest remembrance to her, yourself,
and my good sister, with the same from your troublesome
sister. I rest: Broughton, 13th of April, 1603.
Your troublesome sister,
Anna Broughton.
