My Ever good brother Mr Higgin's opinion was, that my Partner must
be at the bath before May, he is gone thither & on Saturday
I shall hear Doctor Sherwood's opinion: at which time
I would gladly have your Coachman William here, if it
please you: I have sent by this bearer a young mare, to
S. B. for his old one, that died on the way to Cambridge
my man thinks her as good: I desire much the payment
of Sir Walter Harcourt: which I hope I shall hear of by
your man: with my humble duty to my good mother
my Partner's heartiest remembrance to her, yourself
and my good sister: with the like from your troublesome
sister I rest: Broughton .13. of April :1603:
Your troublesome Sister:
Anne Broughton
