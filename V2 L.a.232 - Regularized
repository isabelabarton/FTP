Dear Brother Higgin, I hope this letter finds you well. Brother, Mr. Higgin's opinion was that my partner should
be at the bath before May. He has already gone there, and on Saturday,
I will hear Doctor Sherwood's opinion. At that time,
I would greatly appreciate it if your coachman William could be here, if it
is convenient for you. I have sent a young mare
with the person delivering this message to S.B. as a replacement for his old one that unfortunately died on the way to Cambridge.
My man believes that the new mare is just as good. I kindly request the payment
from Sir Walter Harcourt, and I hope to receive news about it from
your man. Please convey my humble regards to our good mother,
and my partner sends her warmest regards to her, yourself,
and our good sister. I also extend the same regards from your troublesome
sister. Take care. Yours sincerely,
Anne Broughton
