Honorable Lord, I humbly present to you two
letters that were discovered by a courier on the road to Chester, approximately two miles
before reaching the town of Nantwich. The courier brought these letters to
Stone, where he handed them to a certain Thomas Rathbon, an ink purveyor at the Crown Inn.
Upon opening and reviewing the contents, he forwarded them
to me. One of the letters contains explicit evidence
of disloyal subjects harboring treasonous intentions against our
peaceful nation, indicating a desire for change.
Although the other letter holds less significance, I
suspect the sender to be the brother of an individual previously executed alongside
Babington. This circumstance may foster a vengeful disposition in him,
which I trust your Lordship can help prevent through your intervention.
With utmost respect, I entrust you to the mercy of the Almighty.
Blithfield, 27th February 1595.
