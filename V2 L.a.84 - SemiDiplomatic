Right honorable my verie good Lord I send you herein two
letters found by a Carrior in the highe way to Chester, two myles
on this side the towne of Nantwich, which he brought with him to
Stone to one Thomas Rathbon, Inkeper ther at the signe of the Crowne
who breakinge them vp, & pervsinge the Contentes sent them
to me, And for that ther is matter in the one manifestinge the
the trayterous myndes of vnloyall subiectes, envyinge the
quiet estate of our Countrie, with desire of alteracion as may
appeare, Thother not importinge so much, yet for that I
greatlie suspecte him to be the brother of one executed with
Babington might cause him to beare a Revenginge mynd
which I hope by your Lordships good meanes wilbe prevented, And
so with all humble dutie commit you to the mercie of the Allmightie
Blithfild the xxviith of ffebruarie 1595
