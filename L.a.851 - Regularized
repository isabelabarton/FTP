My best cousin.
You shall ever find me as true of my word
to you, and to let you know that I am not unmindful 
of my promise, I writ these lines; I
can writ nothing of that matter you desire to
hear of; for my uncle Samwell is very dangerously sick
and my uncle Sanders is not well; so that their
meeting is uncertain; but at the next return of
the carrier you shall hear more from me, my brother 
Skipwith hath heard of your being at Wymondham, 
by my uncle Wodword; and asked my
brother George of it and he denied it, but he
sayeth nothing to me of you; but told me
he heard you were at the court with my Lord
of Essex; my mother doth use me very
kindly; and thus wishing you as much happiness
and content; as I do myself I rest

the 24th of
March
your faithful friend
Jane Skipwith

my sister remembers
their loves unto you
and I pray you do not
forget my love to Walter
Trew, and let me hear from you as oft
as you can; I have sent you a little
box of marmalade to break your
fast with all /

To my very loving
friend Mr Lewis Bagot
give this
