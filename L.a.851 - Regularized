My dear cousin,
You will always find me true to my word
towards you. I want to assure you that I haven't forgotten
my promises. I am writing these lines to let you know that I am aware of them.
Unfortunately, I cannot provide any information on the specific matter you asked
about. The reason being that my uncle Samwell is currently very ill,
and my uncle Sanders is also unwell. Therefore,
it is uncertain when they will be able to meet. However, I promise to update you in
more detail upon the next return of the carrier. On another note, my brother
Skipwith has heard that you were at Wommadam
through our uncle Woodward. He asked my
brother George about it, and he denied it. However, he
hasn't mentioned anything to me personally. He did tell me
that he heard you were at the court with Lord
Essekes. My mother treats me
kindly, and I hope this letter finds you in as much happiness
and contentment as I am experiencing myself. 

I remain your faithful friend.
March 24th,
Jane Skipwith

My sister sends her regards and
love to you,
and I kindly request you not to
forget to convey my love to Watt
True. Please keep me updated as frequently
as you can. I have also sent you a little
box of marmalade to enjoy 
for breakfast.

To my very loving
friend, Mr. Lewis Bagott,
Please deliver this letter to him.
