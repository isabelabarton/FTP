Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I recently received Mr. Higines' opinion that our partner should
visit the bath before May. He has already gone there, and on Saturday,
I will hear Doctor Shurwoodes' opinion on the matter. At that time,
I would greatly appreciate it if your coachman, William, could be present, if it
is agreeable to you. I have arranged for a young mare to
be sent to Sir B. as a replacement for the one that unfortunately passed away on the way to Cambrige.
My servant believes that she is just as good. I am eagerly awaiting the payment
from Sir Walter Harcote, and I hope to receive
an update from your servant. Please convey my respectful regards to my good mother,
and my partner sends her warmest regards to her, yourself,
and my dear sister. I extend the same sentiments to you from your troublesome
sister. Yours sincerely,
Broughton
