Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I have enclosed
a list of individuals residing near Wisbech Castle 
who are known to be recusants and pose a significant threat. I kindly request that you
consider taking appropriate action, either personally or through other
local justices of the peace, to ensure that they are bound
to appear at the upcoming assizes for the
County of Norfolk. They need to answer to the charges
brought against them on behalf of Her Majesty. 
I take this opportunity to bid you farewell with heartfelt regards. I write this letter from Sergeant's Inn 
on the 20th of June, 1599.

Yours sincerely,
Io. Popham
