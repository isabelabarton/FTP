With my very harty commendacions I have herenclosed
sent you the names of diverse very dangerous recusantes
dwelling near unto Wisbitch Castle whom I pray you
to take some course for either by yourself or some other
Justices of the peace thereabouts That they may be bound
over to appear at the next assizes to be holden for the
County of Norfolk to answer unto such matters as shall be
objected against them on her Majesty's behalf. And even
so I bid you very heartily farewell; At Sergeant's Inn
this twentieth of June 1599.

Your very loving friend,
Io: Popham
