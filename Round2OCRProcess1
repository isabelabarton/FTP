Coffee syrup.
One kilogram of coffee is roasted, ground, and placed in a painted clay jar. 
Two liters of boiling water are poured over it, stirred well with a spatula,
then sealed tightly and left for a day in a rather warm place.
Afterward, it is strained through a filter. To each part of this mixture,
two parts of virgin syrup are added. Then, it is put on low heat and left until it
reaches 32 degrees.
