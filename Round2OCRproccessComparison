Coffee syrup.
One kilogram of coffee is roasted, ground, and placed in a painted clay pot.
Then, two liters of boiling water are poured over it. It's stirred well with a spatula,
sealed tightly, and left for a day in a rather warm place.
Afterward, it's strained through a filter. For every part of this mixture,
two parts of virgin syrup are added. Then, it's placed over gentle heat and left until it
reaches 32 degrees.
