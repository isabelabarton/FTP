Dear Sir, I wanted to inform you and Mr. Edward Littleton that 
I conducted a search within my jurisdiction in Forbridge yesterday. 
The purpose of the search was to find a seminary priest, but unfortunately, 
I was unable to locate anyone matching the given information. However, during my search, 
I discovered unlawful books and some images in one of the closets after breaking the door. 
Although there are several other locked places, I have refrained from opening them until any of 
the commissioners can join me tomorrow morning around eight or nine o'clock. Even though 
I am not a commissioner for recusants, I do not want to allow such lawless individuals to be harbored on my land. 
As a result, I have sent Tulleys' wife to jail, as she is an obstinate recusant and a 
shameless scold. I have been informed that her husband, who is a heavy drinker, frequent swearer, 
and bankrupt, is responsible for all these issues.
I apologize for the hastiness of this message.

Yours faithfully,
E. Stafford
