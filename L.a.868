Sir Because the Bishop our Diocessary is not my friend
I thought best to advertise Sir Edward Littleton & you
of a search that I yesterday made within my Liberties
of Forbridge for a seminary priest who although I
could not find (according to the information) yet upon my
breaking the door of one Closet I found unlawfull books there
& some Images, & although there be diverse other places
there as fastly locked, yet will I forebear to open
any of them until any of you who be Commissioners
will take the pains to come tomorrow morning
about eight or nine a clock there to meet me who
though I am no Commissioner for recusants yet will
not I have any such Lawless persons to be
harbored upon my land, & therefore I have commited
Tully's wife unto the jail being an obstinate
recusant & a shameless scold/ & it is told
me that her husband (being a great drunkard
& a common swearer & a bankrupt) is guilty of all
So in haste I take my leave/ scribbled this
Tuesday morning/

Your Loving Neighbor & assured friend
Edward Stafford
