Dear brother Walter Bagott, I hope this message finds you well. Mr. Higines expressed the opinion that my partner must
be at the bath before May. He has already gone there, and on Satur
day, I will hear Doctor Shurwoode's opinion. At that time,
I would appreciate it if your coachman William could be present, if it
is convenient for you. I have sent a young mare to
S. B. as a replacement for the old one that died on the way to Cambridge.
My servant believes she is just as good. I am eagerly awaiting the payment
from Sir Walter Harcote, which I hope to hear about from
your servant. Please convey my humble regards to my good mother.
My partner sends his warmest greetings to her, yourself,
and my dear sister. I extend the same greetings from your troublesome
sister. Yours sincerely, Broughton 13th of April, 1603
Your troublesome sister,
Anna Broughton

To the respected, my very
good brother, Mr. Walter
Bagott, at Blithfilde. Please deliver
this message promptly.

Ann Broughton
