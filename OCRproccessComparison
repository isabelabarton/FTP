Coffee syrup.
You burn a kilo of coffee, you grind it, and you put it
in a painted earthenware pot. Then you pour
over 2 liters of boiling water, and it is well diluted with
a spatula. Close it hermetically and leave it
for one day in a rather warm place.

Then you pass it through the filter. To every part of this
mixture, add two parts of virgin syrup. Afterward,
it is placed on a gentle fire and left until it
reaches 32 degrees.
