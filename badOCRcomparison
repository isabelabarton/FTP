No 57.  H. M. Colonial Cutter "Snapper"
July 29th 1822

Sir,

I have the Honor to inform your Excellency of
my Arrival in the Snapper as above, and in the execution
of your Excellency's Orders by leave to report as follows.

Having delivered the Provisions and Stores for
Newcastle to the Commandant at that Station.  I proceeded
with all possible dispatch along the Coast to the Northward
and arrived at the Latitude of 28" 30S at Noon of the 14th
Ultimo, the Line of Coast then became the object of my closest
Investigation.  From this Latitude to Point Danger the Land
is High with Sandy beaches in front, bold to half a mile
and clear of Danger, without any Openings or Places of
Shelter.  Off Point Danger lies a small Island. High and
bold to which may be seen about 12 miles off betwen this
and the Reefs to the Eastward of it is a Channel of about
two miles wide perfectly safe by keeping the Island close
on board and steering in about 10 fathoms.

The Reefs are a set of Dangerous Shoals and bear
from the Island SE 2 1/2 miles and stretch as far as ENE
they appear to occupy a space of about 4 miles in a
NE direction

From Point Danger a few miles Northerly the
Land is very High, with low Sandy Land in front, and thence
to within 20 miles of Point Lookout, low sandy Land.  The
while space between those two Points is one continued
Half Moon Sandy beach wiht Regular Soundings and to
within one mile of the Shore perfectly safe to approach

To His Excellency
Major General Sir Thomas Brisbane K.C.B. F.R.S.Etc
