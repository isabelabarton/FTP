Sir,

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency of
my arrival in the Trappean, as above, and, in compliance
with Your Excellency's orders, I hereby report as follows:

Ravens delivered the provisions and stores for
Newenable and the Commandant at that station. I proceeded
with all possible despatch along the coast to the Northesud
and around at the Patstule of 28.30s at none of the It
Ulturs. The five of Court then became the object of my diligent
investigation. From this Latitude to But danger, the land
is high with sandy beaches in front, extending for miles,
and clear of danger without any openings or places of
shelter. However, there is a small island
that can be seen southward, the only one off,
and the parts to the Eactward of it form a channel of about
three miles wide, perfectly safe for causing the stand case C
on bound and steering in about so fathers.

The Russ are a set of dangerous shoals,being four miles away
from the island and stretching as far as an
area of about a mile, as in the 
Not' direction.

From Point Danger, a few miles Northerute, the
land is very high, with low underland in front, and then
within a mile of Part Lockout, low sandy land. The
whole space between those two points is one continuous
beach with regular landings and is the
most suitable and safe appointed I to the Thames, within one mile of the Jorfutly.

I remain, with the utmost respect, Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,
Thomas Brisbane K.C. B. I. A.
Governor-in-Chief
