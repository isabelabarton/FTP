With my very hearty commendations, I have herewith enclosed 
and sent you the names of several very dangerous recusants 
residing near Wisbech Castle. I kindly request that you 
take appropriate action, either personally or through the assistance of other 
Justices of the Peace in the vicinity, to ensure that they are bound 
over to appear at the next assizes for the 
County of Norfolk. They must answer to any charges 
brought against them on behalf of Her Majesty. In conclusion, 
I bid you a heartfelt farewell from Sergeant's Inn, 
this 20th of June 1599.

Your sincerely devoted friend,
John Popham
